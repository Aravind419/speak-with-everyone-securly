# Audio Issue Fixes

## Problem Identified
The audio was not working in the application due to several issues in the WebRTC implementation:

1. **Missing WebRTC Signaling Event Handlers**: The client-side code was missing proper event listeners for WebRTC signaling (offer, answer, ICE candidates).

2. **Incomplete WebRTC Connection Lifecycle**: The WebRTC connection was not being properly established due to missing steps in the offer/answer exchange.

3. **Incorrect Media Stream Handling**: The local media stream was not always being properly attached to the video elements.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added Proper WebRTC Signaling Event Handlers
- Added dedicated event listeners for `offer`, `answer`, and `ice-candidate` events
- Implemented proper cleanup of event listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Ensured signaling messages are properly exchanged between peers

### 2. Fixed WebRTC Connection Lifecycle
- Separated the offer creation into its own function (`createOffer`)
- Added proper error handling for all WebRTC operations
- Implemented connection state monitoring for debugging purposes

### 3. Improved Media Stream Handling
- Ensured local media stream is properly attached to video elements for both audio and video calls
- Added proper cleanup of media tracks when ending calls
- Fixed the timing of offer creation to allow for proper connection setup

### 4. Enhanced Socket Server Implementation
- Improved the WebRTC signaling message routing in the socket server
- Ensured signaling messages are properly broadcast to other users in the room

## Technical Details

### Client-Side Changes
1. **Added WebRTC Signaling Event Handlers**:
   - Created dedicated useEffect hook for WebRTC signaling events
   - Implemented proper handlers for offer, answer, and ICE candidate exchange
   - Added cleanup functions to prevent memory leaks

2. **Fixed WebRTC Initialization**:
   - Separated offer creation into its own function
   - Added proper timing delays for connection setup
   - Improved error handling and logging

3. **Enhanced Media Stream Management**:
   - Ensured local stream is always attached to video elements
   - Added proper cleanup of media tracks

### Server-Side Changes
1. **Improved Signaling Message Routing**:
   - Enhanced the socket server to properly route WebRTC signaling messages
   - Ensured messages are sent to the correct recipients

## Testing
To test the audio functionality:
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/room/PUBLIC123?type=public
3. Click "Audio" in both windows
4. Grant permission for microphone access
5. You should now hear audio from both participants

## Additional Notes
- The implementation now properly handles both audio and video calls
- Added connection state monitoring for debugging purposes
- Implemented proper error handling for all WebRTC operations
- Fixed potential memory leaks by properly cleaning up event listeners and media tracks
